"""
This script organizes files into directories based on their file types and the first character of their filenames.
It supports moving or copying files from a source directory to a destination directory, with options for recursion,
verbosity, and dry-run simulation.

Usage:
    python script_name.py [source] [destination] [-a {move,copy}] [-r] [-v] [-d]

Arguments:
    source (str): Source directory containing the files to be organized.
    destination (str): Destination base directory where files will be organized.
    -a, --action (str): Action to perform: 'move' or 'copy' files (default: 'move').
    -r, --recursive: Recursively search for files in the source directory (default: False).
    -v, --verbose: Enable verbose output showing each operation.
    -d, --dry-run: Simulate the script actions without making any changes.
    -h, --help: Show the help message and exit.

Functionality:
    - The script defines a set of main directories and their associated file extensions.
    - It walks through the source directory (recursively or non-recursively) to find files matching the defined extensions.
    - Files are organized into subdirectories within the main directories based on the first character of their filenames.
      If the first character is not an alphabet, they are placed in a '0_9' directory.
    - The script can either move or copy the files based on the specified action.
    - Verbose mode provides detailed output of each operation.
    - Dry-run mode simulates the actions without making any changes to the filesystem.

Functions:
    - create_directory_if_needed(path): Creates a directory if it doesn't exist and prints the action if verbose or dry-run is enabled.
    - move_file(source, destination_dir): Handles file move with overwrite confirmation.
    - copy_file(source, destination_dir): Handles file copy.
